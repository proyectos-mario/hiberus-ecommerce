# Ecommerce application for Hiberus

Welcome to e-commerce simulate for hiberus Test for Java Microservices.

## Technologies and tools:

I use this technologies for build the project because Spring boot and docker are one of the best solutions for microservices system, because offer well support,well security also Java has a lot of experienced in applications and docker works very well with containers and it can be adapted in more complex architecture using tools like kuberentes for charge balanced in services.

- Java version "1.8.0_241"
- Spring tools suite 4 (IDE)
- Spring boot 2.3.1
- Spring Data
- Maven
- Docker version 19.03.8
- Docker-compose version 1.25.5
- Swagger 2.7.0
- User SO: Windows 10 Pro
- Git version 2.26.0
- Postgres Database
- Postman

## Design

![alt text](https://github.com/proyectos-mario/hiberus-ecommerce/blob/master/images/design.png?raw=true)

In this design, I create a principal service called checkoutservice, this service start the process and later call billservice that compute the sum of product values per quantity. Later Checkout process call logisticservice that save in order database table the sum of billservice, address info, order date, client id, generation date (Date of execution of service) and a number or sent order, this sent order number is given to database sequence called order_id_seq. This service return a OutLogisticVO object to checkoutservice and later this service return a OutCheckOutVO object and finish the process.

In this project is used 6 containers isolated and connected to docker network provided and configured for docker-compose technology. I exposed ports to local machine for testing purposes.



 ## This project has six Microservices:

- **CheckOutService:**  (./checkoutecommerce folder): This service begin the process and call Bill service and Logistic service
- **CheckOutService Database:** This services is a postgres database that include Clients info
- **BillService:** (./billecommerce folder): This service receive Date, ClientId, Products info and get sum of products values
- **BillService Database:** : This services is another postgres database that include products info. (This database is different that Checkout Database)
- **Logisticservice:** (./logisticecommerce): This services is responsible of generation of sent order. It creates a number Id and return this value in an OutLogisticVO object, also create a register in Order table with the Sent order info.
- **LogisticService Database:**: This services is another postgres database that include order info. (This database is different that Checkout Database) and generate an Order Id with ecommercelogistic.order_id_seq database sequence

# Java Projects

This backend solution are implemented with Java spring boot , spring data and maven. You can open this projects with Spring tools suite 4 and import this maven projects if you need to see the code:

1) checkoutecommerce
2) logisticecommerce
3) billecommerce
4) voecommerce

If you change something in the code and you need to compile and see this changes, you have to execute this steps:

```
docker-compose rm -f
docker-compose up --build -d
```

## Installation

The package can be installed via docker-compose functionality, first download the project via github and later execute docker-compose:

1) Clone repository from github
```
git clone git@github.com:proyectos-mario/hiberus-ecommerce.git

```
2) Execute docker-compose

```
docker-compose up --build -d
```

3) You can check if the 6 services are up with this docker command:

```
docker ps
```
And you should be see something like this:

4) If you need to stop the process execute:

```
docker-compose rm -f
```

## Swagger Documentation

Once the project has been installed,  This project generate swagger documentation in this links:

- [http://localhost:7002/swagger-ui.html](http://localhost:7002/swagger-ui.html). CheckOut documentation
- [http://localhost:7000/swagger-ui.html](http://localhost:7000/swagger-ui.html). Billing documentation
- [http://localhost:7001/swagger-ui.html](http://localhost:7001/swagger-ui.html). Logistic documentation

# How this work

## localhost public urls (Why?)

That you can see, I use localhost for all services. That is because willfully, I expose APIs in localmachine for testing purposes for API services and database services, but internally microservices use its own network for connect its containers  thanks to Docker and Docker-compose technology. A easy test to see it,  is delete expose port in docker-compose file and with this you can put private one or various microservices. It can see in docker-compose file like this

```
...
ports: 
      - "7000:7000" 
...
```
With this you can get rest services or connect local to databases

# Start to work!!!

## Before to start

This project connects with database elements like products or clients and get elements like orders, so I build 3 services to help you to get data to test this service. This get rest services are:

+ [http://localhost:7002/api/getClients](http://localhost:7002/api/getClients). Client List
+ [http://localhost:7000/api/getProducts](http://localhost:7000/api/getProducts). Product List
+ [http://localhost:7001/api/getOrders](http://localhost:7001/api/getOrders). Order List (This service show the result of executions of entire process)


## Checkout Service


First, you should run this post service in **Postman** or another rest tool for http://localhost:7002/api/checkout and put in the body something like this:

```json
{
  "clientId": 1,
  "date": "2020-07-01T00:19:43.509Z",
  "direction": "Carrera 11 # 140 -52",
  "products": [
    {
      "cost": 100.5,
      "id": 1,
      "quantity": 2
    },
    {
      "cost": 200.3,
      "id": 2,
      "quantity": 3
    }
  ]
} 
```
When this process is executed you get a response like this:


```json
{
    "procesoOk": true,
    "message": "Correct CheckOut",
    "logisticOut": {
        "procesoOk": true,
        "message": "Logistic out ok",
        "numberOrder": 1
    },
    "billOut": {
        "procesoOk": true,
        "message": "Bill process pass ok",
        "sum": 801.9000000000001
    }
}
```
As you can see this json return a procesoOk=true if all procedures are ok also return the bill response with billOut object and logistic response with logisticOut object. If the process fail, the procesoOk = false and show message error in "message"
